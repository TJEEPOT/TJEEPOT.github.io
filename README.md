# What It Does #
This is the codebase for my personal Github page, which I use to show off my projects and talk a little about myself. 
It's mostly a CV without limits so I can be as wordy as I like and users can just scroll past what they're not interested in.

# What I Learned #
For me, this project was mostly just a case of getting back into web design and use of Git (and Github). This is the first Github Pages site I've hosted, but it only took 5 minutes to learn how to host the site I'd built. I did work with Font Awesome for the first time, but again, the way it's built made it incredibly easy to start using.

# Usage Notes #
Just go to https://tjeepot.github.io/ to see the site in action.
