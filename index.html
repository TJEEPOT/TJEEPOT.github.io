							<h2>Who I am</h2>
							<p>I'm currently a third year Computer Science student at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK, graduating in 2021. After some years of working in the Housing sector and many years being interested in all things tech, I decided to leave my former career in 2017 to study full-time for a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with a focus from the start on AI and Machine Learning. I have had a wide range of interests within Computer Science as detailed below.<p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon major solid brands fa-java"></span>
									<h3>Java Programming</h3>
									<p>Java is my go-to language for personal projects, I even used it for my capstone project in my third year for creating tools for a Machine Learning toolkit. I like to keep up-to-date with the latest happenings with Java through Reddit communities and through conference videos on YouTube.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major solid fa-lock"></span>
									<h3>Developing Secure Applications</h3>
									<p>I developed more of an interest in computer security after working on user authentication in Java for my Event Booking System project, which led me to studying two modules on it in my third year.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major solid fa-brain"></span>
									<h3>Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence</h3>
									<p>I had been interested in the impact smaller projects in ML were making to computing back before I left my former career, so after researching it in more detail, I decided that would be the field I would prioritise going forward.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major solid fa-code"></span>
									<h3>C++ Programming</h3>
									<p>I've so far completed a couple small projects in C++ in order to understand how it differs from Java and to get a solid understand of the use of pointers, however I'm moving away from using C++ to focus more learning on Rust, due to the latter's inherent security benefits.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major solid brands fa-html5"></span>
									<h3>Developing for the Web</h3>
									<p>Although it hasn't been a focus of my time, I've find myself working on web apps and sites quite often. HTML5 and CSS3 are a given, of course, but I've spent quite some time on SQL databases too - SQLite, Postgres and MariaDB - and understanding the best ways to move to and from them efficiently as well as how to securely store data within them.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major solid fa-project-diagram"></span>
									<h3>Software Development Lifecycle</h3>
									<p>I have experience with Agile Development concepts such as prioritising interactions over processes; producing software over documentation and responding to change over following a solid plan, after having used these concepts to manage a couple small group projects. These projects have also required knowledge and use of UML, Class Diagrams, ERD and OOP principles.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major solid fa-microchip"></span>
									<h3>Digital and Analogue Electronics</h3>
									<p>I have completed a small project programming a bare metal digital circuits in the form of an Intel FPGA which was used implement a state machine to control a set of traffic lights. For an Analogue Electronics project, I built a modulator and amplifier to transmit music through a metal bar, and used a demodulator circuit to turn it back into an audible signal.</p>
